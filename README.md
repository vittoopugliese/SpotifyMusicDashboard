  - **Yours**: Your playlists (with user token).
- **UX**: Dark mode, responsive layout, skeleton loaders/spinner, and caching for snappy feel.

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Why these?)

- **Next.js (App Router)**: File-based routing and server actions for a clean API layer via `app/api/*` route handlers.
- **TypeScript**: Safer, more maintainable code.
- **Shadcn UI + Radix**: Accessible, composable UI primitives.
- **Recharts**: Clean data visualizations.
- **Spotify Web API**: User profile, top artists/tracks, and audio features.
- **Next Route Handlers**: Encapsulate auth, token refresh, and API calls in one place.

## 📦 Project Highlights

- `lib/spotify.ts`: Spotify API helpers, token management, and utilities (grouping, averages, year parsing).
- `app/api/spotify/*`: Secure server-side endpoints for login, callback, refresh, session, and data fetches.
- `hooks/*`: Client hooks for token, data, and mobile behavior.
- `components/*`: Composable UI and layout building blocks.

## ⚠️ Important: Do NOT use localhost

For Spotify OAuth redirects, use `http://127.0.0.1:3000` instead of `http://localhost:3000`.

- The dev server is already bound to `127.0.0.1` via package scripts.
- Configure Spotify Redirect URI using `127.0.0.1` (see Quick Start below).

## 🚀 Quick Start

1) **Clone and install**
```
git clone https://github.com/vittoopugliese/SpotifyMusicDashboard
cd spotify-music-dashboard
npm install
```

2) **Create a Spotify App**
- Go to the Spotify Developer Dashboard and create an application.
- Set the Redirect URI to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/spotify/callback
```
Note: Do not use `localhost` for the Redirect URI.

3) **Environment variables**
Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:
```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
```

4) **Run the app**
```
npm run dev
```
Open:
```
http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

5) **Log in with Spotify**
- Use the “Log in” action in the app.
- After consent, you’ll be redirected to the dashboard with your data.

## 🔐 Auth & Tokens

- `GET /api/spotify/login`: Starts OAuth with a CSRF-protected state cookie.
- `GET /api/spotify/callback`: Exchanges code for access/refresh tokens and stores them in HTTP-only cookies.
- `POST /api/spotify/refresh`: Refreshes the access token when needed.
- `GET /api/spotify/session`: Returns `authenticated` and lightweight profile info.
- `GET /api/spotify/logout`: Clears cookies and redirects back to the dashboard.

## 🧭 Notable Data Endpoints

- `GET /api/spotify/top-artists`
- `GET /api/spotify/top-tracks`

These wrap Spotify endpoints via server-side fetches defined in `lib/spotify.ts`.

## 🧪 Scripts

```
npm run dev    # starts Next.js bound to 127.0.0.1
npm run build  # builds for production
npm run start  # serves the production build bound to 127.0.0.1
```

## 📁 Minimal File Map

- `app/` – Routes (pages and API route handlers)
- `components/` – Reusable UI and layout
- `hooks/` – Client hooks
- `lib/` – Spotify helpers, caching, and utils

## ✅ Notes

- If you see auth issues, re-check the Redirect URI and that you’re opening `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.
- Token refresh is handled transparently; if it fails, you may be logged out.
- This project aims for clean, accessible UI with a responsive layout and dark mode.
